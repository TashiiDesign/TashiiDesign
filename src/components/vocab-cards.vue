        <p>The client required cards to be used with students for the
purpose of learning the langauge in a fun and interesting
way. He did not have any specific design requests however.
This meant that it was up to me to showcase my own
creativity and ideas.</p>
      <p>I narrowed down the key features of the cards. Firstly, they
needed to be readable and clear for students to learn.
Secondly, as the client stated that he wanted something
interesting and fun, I decided to add this with bright accent
colours. Pairing this with simple typography and a dark
background made the characters distinct.</p>
