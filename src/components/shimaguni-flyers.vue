              This flyer was intended to advertise the
company’s ‘club’ where workshops and language
exchanges were going to be held. For this project, the
client didn’t really have any major ideas except the
addition of contact and social media information at the
bottom. </p>
<p> used blue, red and white as the main colour
scheme and created a wave effect for the background to
further emphasize the island aspect.</p>

<p>This flyer was created to advertise the company’s Japanese
lessons. The client asked for two unique characters conversing
in traditional Japanese clothing as the primary design on the
front of the card.</p>

<p>On the back, he wanted more information, including the
Japanese flag as well as links to their social media. Blue, green
and red are the company’s primary colours so these were
incorporated here as well.</p>
