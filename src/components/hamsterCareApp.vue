        <p>In order to practice JS, I decided to create a small application on a topic very dear to my heart.
            Hamsters are often seen as small, "easy to care for" and "cheap" pets, when in reality, they need
            much more care than people realise for them to thrive. 
        </p>
         <p>The goal of this application was to practice using JS Classes. </p>

      <v-card-text>
        <p>Application that allows users to input information in order to check and give advice on better care.</p>
          
          <p>Users should input their hamster's information, and what they are providing for them. The application 
              will calculate their enclosure's floorspace as well as check how much enrichment is being provided.
              Based on the information given, the application will provide advice to hopefully educate new hamster owners on better care. 
          </p>
