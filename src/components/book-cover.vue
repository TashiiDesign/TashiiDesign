        <p>  The client required a booklet they could give out to students. They didnâ€™t have a preference for the design
        but wanted it to be appealing to both kids and adults.</p>
        
      <p>The primary colours, orange and green, were chosen to emulate a calm yet
        invigorating study experience and tend to be used quite alot in Japanese
        learning resources. I wanted to showcase some of
        the characters that students will
        learn in the book, so this was the
        inspiration for the cover. The grid
        gives a clean and minimal look
        but appealing enough for a first
        impression.</p>
