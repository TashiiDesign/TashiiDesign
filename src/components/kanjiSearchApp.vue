        <p>As I am learning Japanese, I thought it might be fun to create a Kanji search application using the Kanji Alive API. 
        </p>

        <p>The goal of this application was to practice using APIs as well as research more into writing re-usable code. This can be seen
          in my creation of the autocomplete widget which can be re-used to suit any data as it in itself is not aware of any specific data nor 
          does it rely on specific HTML markup. In addition, I was also able to learn how to use the Tailwind.css framework and was pleased
          with the level of flexibility it offered compared to others like Bulma. 
        </p>

        <p>Application that allows users to input information in order to check and give advice on better care.</p>
          
          <p>Users can search a Kanji or simple english word in order to find more information about that single Kanji, as 
            well as 2 examples on how it is used. </p>
