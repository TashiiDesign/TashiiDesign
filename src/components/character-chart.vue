      <v-card-text>
        <p>The owner of a local Japanese Language School, required a basic reading chart in the form of a branded
poster for his classroom.</p>
      <p>Using a simple geometric background texture created mimimal dimension for substance but not enough to overpower
the calm feeling. A grid was used to create equal spacing between characters for the best clarity and readability.
Finally, the poster was branded with the company's Logo, neatly placed at the bottom right corner.</p>
