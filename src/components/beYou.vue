      <v-card-text>
        <p>The objective of this project was to provide
a brand design that is vibrant, fun and
social.</p>
<p>Beyou is a new and upcoming health bar.
The aim was to create a package design
that is trendy and unique and should
appeal to the main audience for the
product, ‘women on the move’.</p>

      <p>Each flavour was given 2 colours in order to
keep the design simple and effective. The designs were created using the 2 colours
chosen for each flavour as well as various
imagery combined together to showcase
the proper flavours.</p>

<p>After experimenting with typefaces, 2 were chosen, which showcased a sense
of playfulness. However, to create more character, the characters ‘e’ and ‘u’
were extended using the pen tool and a curve was added to the end to further
accentuate the playful theme. Playing on the ‘Be You’ name, I created the
slogan, ‘Be unique. Be you.’, as this is simple yet easily describes the message
that the brand wants to convey.</p>
